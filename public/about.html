        <p>Kenji Herbert is a quintessential contemporary musician. Crossing stylistic and cultural boundaries with ease, he has distilled his unique background and diverse influences into a guitar sound characteristically his own. Born in Vienna, raised in Japan, after studies in Switzerland and Boston, he now resides in Brooklyn, New York and can be heard performing in a wide variety of contexts touching on jazz and improvised music, as well as various interdisciplinary settings.</p>

        <p>Born into a musical family to an Austrian father and Japanese mother in 1987, Kenji began his training on the violin, studying classical music from age 6. He discovered a passion for the guitar at 14 and was initially, largely self-taught. Upon attending the Seminar for Jazz and Improvised Music Salzburg, which was organized by his uncle, acclaimed bassist, composer Peter Herbert, in 2004, he decided to pursue a career in music. Regularly attending this workshop for the next 5 years, he studied with the most forward thinking musicians active today including, Wolfgang Muthspiel, Jim Black, Mark Dresser, Skuli Sverrisson, Ellery Eskelin, and Nguyen Le among others.</p>

        <p>In 2006, he moved to Basel, Switzerland to study with Wolfgang Muthspiel for two years at the city’s Music Academy. He transferred to Berklee College of Music in 2009 on scholarship to further his studies in the United States. Under the tutelage of Mick Goodrick and David Tronzo he further consolidated his own concepts and approach to the guitar. While a student at Berklee, he continued to be in demand professionally in Japan and Europe as a leader and collaborator on diverse projects.</p>

        <p>In 2010, Kenji was one of 14 students to be selected as the inaugural class of the Berklee Global Jazz Institute, under the artistic direction of renowned pianist, composer Danilo Peréz. This lead to wide-spread international attention through appearances at high profile venues and festivals, studies with a number of celebrated jazz musicians such as Wayne Shorter, Joe Lovano, John Patitucci, Ben Street, and Dave Liebman, and various educational and social service activities which were an integral part of the program.</p>

        <p>After graduating Berklee, summa cum laude and relocating to New York in 2011, Kenji is quickly establishing a name for himself in the city’s competitive music environment as a highly versatile and individual voice on the guitar. ‘Superluminal,’ a documentation of improvised music with his close collaborators bassist Aaron Darrell and drummer Devin Drobka, was released in November 2012. Aside from leading his own ensembles, he is a member of the Yuhan Su Quintet, Bakia Quartet (improvised music to silent film), and the Scruffy Herberts (a collaborative project with Peter Herbert). He composed and performed for a contemporary dance piece choreographed by Jessica Cipriano, which premiered at the Lincoln Center Institute in 2012 and was part of Ragnar Kjartansson’s exhibit ‘Me, My Father, My Mother and I’, which ran at the New Museum in 2014. The same year, he was the featured guitarist for the world-premiere of the opera, Trans-Maghreb at the Bregenz Festival. An album featuring Kenji’s compositions is scheduled for release on Greg Osby’s Inner Circle Music label in the Fall 2016.</p>
